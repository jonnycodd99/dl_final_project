This project evaluates the impact of the 2024 Catalonian
drought policies on vegetative health. We exploit that Cat-
aloniaâ€™s neighbouring region, Aragon, did not implemented a
drought policy and focus on areas close to their shared border.
We further limit these areas to urban and agricultural lands,
ensuring an analysis of lands directly impacted by the drought
policies. For this purpose we employed the DeepLabV3+
image segmentation model, which we fine-tuned with the
DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset to identify land
cover classes.

The empirical framework leveraged a difference-in-difference
approach with border segment fixed effects. Our results indi-
cate a significant decrease in vegetative health by 0.02 on the
NDVI scale due to the drought policies, supporting the hy-
pothesis that severe irrigation limits would negatively impact
vegetation. This finding highlights the adverse short term
effects of the 2024 drought policies on vegetation in Catalo-
nia. With our project we hope to provide valuable insights
for future drought management strategies in Mediterranean
climates.
